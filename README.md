# Marathon-EDA
Conducted an in-depth EDA on a dataset of 7M+ ultra marathon race records (1798â€“2022) sourced from Kaggle, with a focus on personal race experiences (50K & 50-mile races in 2020).

Cleaned and transformed raw data by handling null values, mixed data types, and formatting issues to prepare it for meaningful analysis.

Filtered and analyzed races by distance, year, gender, and age to derive insights into athlete performance, seasonal trends, and demographic patterns.

Built compelling visualizations using Seaborn (histograms, violin plots) to highlight trends in pace, gender comparisons, seasonal performance variation, and age-performance correlation.
